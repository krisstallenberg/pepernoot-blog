## About new statistics

The new statistics:
- Estimation approach to statistics

In addition, we'll do some 'old' statistics:
- Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) 

### What's the problem with 'old' statistics?

- It involves dichotomous thinking, i.e. they try to answer yes/no-questions with quantitative research. Instead of asking questions like 'to what extend [...]?'
- It's widely misunderstood
- Usually it doesn't tell you what you want to know
- It's hard to compare results of different studies based on the results of significance tests.
  
Note: NHST is covered in week 3 of the course.

### What's NHST again?

- To prove a claim, discredit the all-chance explanation.
- You need to translate the all-chance explanation into a statistical model. This model is called the null-hypothesis.
- Next, show that your data is inconsistent with the statistical model (i.e. the null-hypothesis).
- Inconsistency of data and null-hypothesis is measured with p-value. Smaller p-value means more inconsistent.
- p < .05 means there's a significant result.
- If the null hypothesis is true, results like these happen less than 5% of the times. In other words, p = .05 indicates there's a 5% chance that the results are due to chance.
- If p > .05, usually we say:
  - There's no effect.
  - There's no evidence.
  - The research hypothesis is rejected.
- All of these conclusions are incorrect. The p-value only tells us about the chance the results are due to chance.

> If a p-value tells us what the chance is that the results are due to chance. What

## New statistics: estimation

Focuses on how-much and how precise
- How much? Answer: estimate of effect size
- How precise? Answer: confidence intervals/credible intervals

- These are less likely to be misunderstood.
- Explicit focus on effect size and uncertainty
- Relatively easy to compare the results of different studies.

> Why is the confidence interval of the other studies relatively large?
