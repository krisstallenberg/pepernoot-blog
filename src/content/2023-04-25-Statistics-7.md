## Assignment 1

### Why is CI a factor of sample size and variability

- Standard error = sigma (Ïƒ) / square root of sample size
- MoE = 1.96 * standard error
- CI = Mean +/- MoE

## Paired or independent group design

- In paired design: participants are matched (based on characteristics that may be relevant to the study) and then the pairs are divided over two groups or more groups.
- Independent group design: all participants are randomly assigned to groups.
