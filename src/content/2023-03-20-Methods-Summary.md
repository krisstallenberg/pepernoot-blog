## Chapter 1

### Module 1: Basics

What are ways of acquiring knowledge? 
- **Superstition**: Gaining knowledge through subjective feelings, belief in chance, or belief in magical events.
- **Intuition**: Gaining knowledge without being consciously aware of where the knowledge came from.
- **Authority**
- **Tenacity**: Gaining knowledge by clinging stubbornly to repeated ideas, despite evidence to the contrary.
- **Rationalism**: Gaining knowledge through logical reasoning
- **Empiricism**: Gaining knowledge through observation of organisms and events in the real world.
- **Science**: combines rationalism and empiricism
  - A hypothesis is a prediction regarding the outcome of the study.
  - The hypothesis often involves the relationship between two variables.
  - The goal of testing hypotheses is to form or test a theory: an organized system of principles and assumptions to explain phenomena.
    - Theories help explain data, they let us develop a framework regarding facts.

#### Scepticism

Science involves _scepticism_, which means questioning the validity, authenticity, or truth of something purporting to be factual.

Being a skeptic and using the scientific method involve applying three important criteria that help define science:
1. **Systematic empiricism**: Empiricism by itself isn't enough. Observations must be made in a systematic matter. 
2. **Public verification**: Research needs to presented in such a way that it can be observed, replicated, criticized, and tested for veracity by others.
3. **Empirically solvable problems**: Science focuses on problems that can be solved using the currently available research techniques and methods of collecting data. Theories must be falsibiable, meaning the theory must be stated in such a way that it is possible to refute or disconfirm it. 

#### Goals of science

Scientific research has three goals:

1. Describe
2. Predict
3. Explain

### Module 2: Introduction to research methods

Terminology:
- Population: All the people about whom a study is meant to generalize.
- Sample: The group of people who participate in a study.
  - Random sample: A sample achieved through random selection in which each member of the population is equally likely to be chosen.

**Descriptive** methods include:
- Observational method: making observations of human or other animal behavior.
  - Naturalistic observation: observing the behavior of humans or other animals in their natural habitats.
  - laboratory observation: Observing the behavior of humans or other animals in a contrived and controlled situation, usually the laboratory.
- Case study method: An in-depth study of one or more individuals.
- Survey method: Questioning individuals on a topic or topics and then describing their responses.

**Predicitive** methods include:
- Correlational method: a method that assesses the degree of relationship between two variables.
  - Correlation does not imply causation.
  - There are positive and negative correlations.
- Quasi-experimental method: research that compares naturally occurring groups of individuals; the variable of interest cannot be manipulated.
  - For example when assessing the health effects of smoking, scientists don't make people smoke, because this is unethical. Instead, they study people who smoke and compare them to people who don't. One downside of this method is the room for alternative explanations, which is the idea that it is possible some other uncontrolled, extraneous variable may be responsible for the observed relationship. This uncontrolled variable is also called a confounding variable.

**Explanatory** methods include:
- **Experimental method**: a research method that allows a researcher to establish a cause- and-effect relationship through manipulation of a variable and control of the situation. 
  - The basic premise of experimentation is that the researcher controls as much as possible to determine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the variables being studied.
  - Researchers manipulate at least one variable (independent variable), and measure at least one variable (dependent variable)
  - Researchers control variables to exclude alternative explanations. 
  - Besides controlling variables, researchers ensure there's random assignment to eliminate differences between the groups.

### Module 3

A research article in a scientific magazine is often structured as follows:
- **Abstract**: a brief description of the entire paper and typically discusses the other sections (Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion). Depending on the journal, these are usually between 150 and 250 words. The Abstract describes the **problem** under investigation and the **purpose** of the study, the **participants** and general **methodology**, the **findings**, and the **conclusions** and implications or applications of the study.
- **Introduction**: has three components:
    1. An introduction to the problem under study.
    2. A review of relevant previous research, which cites works that are pertinent to the issue but not works of marginal or peripheral significance.
    3. The purpose and rationale for the study.
- **Method**: describes exactly how the study was conducted and provides sufficient detail that a person who reads the Method section could replicate the study. It usually has four components:
    1. Participants/subjects subsection includes a description of the participants and how they were obtained. 
    2. Materials subsection usually describes any testing materials used such as a particular test or inventory or a type of problem that participants were asked to solve.
    3. Apparatus subsection describes any specific equipment used. 
    4. The Procedure subsection summarizes each step in the execution of the research, including the groups used in the study, instructions given to the participants, the experimental manipulation, and specific control features in the design.
- **Results**: summarizes the data collected and the type of statistic used to analyze the data. In addition, the results of the statistical tests used are reported with respect to the variables measured and/or manipulated. 
- **Discussion**: this is where the results are evaluated and interpreted. Finally, criticisms of the study and implications for future research are presented.

### Module 5: Defining, measuring and manipulating variables

Goals of this module are: 
- Explain and give examples of an operational definition.
- Explain the four properties of measurement and how they are related to the four scales of measurement.
- Identify and describe the four types of measures.

When a researcher wants to study variable that is not concrete or easily measured, they need to operationalize

Researchers must operationally define all variables, both dependent and independent.

#### Properties of measurement

There are four levels of measurement:
1. Identity: different scores mean different identities, e.g. political orientation.
2. Magnitude: The ordering of the numbers reflects the order of the variable. A higher score means 'more' of the variable was measured.
3. Equal unit size: The same difference in score reflects the same difference in the variable measured. 
4. Absolute zero: A score of 0 means an absence of the variable. 

#### Scales of measurement

There are four scales of measurement:
1. Nominal: A scale in which objects or individuals are assigned to categories that have no numerical properties.
    Has the following properties of measurement:
   - Identity
2. Ordinal: A scale in which objects or indivi- duals are categorized and the categories form a rank order along a continuum. For example ranking players from 1 to 10 based on their results.
    Has the following properties of measurement:
    - Identity
    - Magnitude
3. Interval: A scale in which the units of measurement (intervals) between the numbers on the scale are all equal in size (but no absolute zero). For example the Fahrenheit temperature scale.
    Has the following properties of measurement:
    - Identity
    - Magnitude
    - Equal unit size
4. Ratio: A scale in which in addition to order and equal units of measurement there is an absolute zero that indicates an absence of the variable being measured. For example weight expressed in kg.
    Has the following properties of measurement:
    - Identity
    - Magnitude
    - Equal unit size
    - Absolute zero

#### Discrete or continuous

Variables can be:
- Discrete: Changes in the value occur in a whole unit; there are no decimals. Nominal and ordinal data are often discrete.
- Continuous: Change in the value may occur in fractional units; there are decimals. Most interval and ratio data are continuous.

#### Types of measure

- Self-reported measures
- Tests
- Behavioural measure
- Physical measures

### Module 6: Reliability and validity

#### Reliability

One way of determining whether the measure you use is effective is to assess its **reliability**. 

Reliability refers to the consistency or stability of a measuring instrument. In other words, the measuring instrument must measure exactly the same way every time it is used. This consistency means we should receive a similar score each time they use the measuring instrument for the same object.
