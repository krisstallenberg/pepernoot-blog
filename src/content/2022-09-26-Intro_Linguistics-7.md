# Semantics

The meaning of a noun cosists of its:

- Sense
- Reference

## Reference 

### A noun

The reference of a noun is a set of entities. 
The reference of 'a' + noun is an indefinite instance of an entity/member in the set.

### A verb

The reference of a verb is a set of actions.

### Problems with reference

1. Referents aren't stable, for example 'the President of the United States'
2. Some referents don't exist, for example 'unicorn'
3. Referents may not be unique, for example 'morning star and evening star'
4. Abstract words don't have referents

## Form to meaning relationships

Form to meaning relationships are many-to-many, for example:
- The word (form) 'running' can refer to a running nose or a running person.
- The concept (meaning) of walking can be referred to as 'walking', 'taking a stroll', 'hiking' etc.

## Sense

- Meaning is a cognitive process
- Sense is a 'concept'

### Sense as definition (dictionary-style)

Problems include:
- Definitions are circular. Using words to describe words creates loops (either long or short).
- When are properties sufficient for unique reference

### Sense as prototype

A prototype acts as a mental expectation. A prototype can be defined in terms of:

1. A set of default properties
2. An exemplary entity 'a good example'
3. A basic level (???)

### Sense as a mental image

For a word (form), you have a mental visual example.

#### Problems
- You can't create a 'mental picture' for abstract words

### Sense as usage

You know words through context. 

### Combined sense

To know what a word means:

1. Form a dictionary-style description
2. Find a prototype:
   1. List the defining properties of the prototype
   2. If possible, form a mental image
3. Study the use of the word (examples)

## Ambiguity

Ambiguity is contextual. For example, in a supermarket asking for eggs is specific enough to refer to a chicken's unfertilized eggs. Whereas asking for cheese in a supermarket isn't specific enough to refer to e.g. Gouda cheese. 

Lexical ambiguity:
- Polysemy: a word with multiple, related meanings
- Vagueness: the meaning of the word is not specific enough
- Homonymy: a word with multiple, unrelated meanings

Syntactic ambiguity:
- For example, "Jimmy saw Susan without binoculars"

# Lexical relations

There is another answer to the question "What is a concept?": the lexicon is a semantic network. 

- Hypo- and hyperonymy: respectively the subset and superset. For example, dog is a hypernym of labrador. human is a hyponym of mammal.
- Antonymy
- Meronymy
- Other relations

These types of relationships form a network.

## Antonymy

- Complementary antonyms: married–unmarried
- Gradual antonyms: warm–cold
- Reverse antonyms: Ascent–descent 
- Converse antonyms: Sending–receiving

## Other relations

- man–woman, stallion–mare
- horse–foal, dog–pup

# Compositional semantics

The meaning of sentences. 

## Compositionality 

The meaning of a sentence is the result of the meaning of the words and the way they are combined.
This isn't always true. 

Compositionality can be expressed in a syntax tree.

### Sentence

A sentence is a statement on the basis of entities (with properties) that participate in events (with properties).
- Sentence = noun phrase + verb phrase
- Statement = something that can be given a truth value

Sentences:
- Can be true or false
- Contain a verb phrase and a noun phrase

The meaning of the sentence 

Whether a sentence has meaning is determined by whether it can have a truth value.

## Truth values
