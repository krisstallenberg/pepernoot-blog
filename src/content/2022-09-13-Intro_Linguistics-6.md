# Syntax

The organization of words in an utterance (a spoken sentence spoken by a person, in a context. A sentence is solely a string of characters. An utterance involves pragmatics).

## Overview

- Words
- Part of speech
- Constituents
- Hierarchy
- Sentence

## Syntax

Trees are used to visualize hierarchy. 

- A sentence consists of constituents.
- A Constituent consists of constituents and part of speeches (PoS).
- A part of speech consist of words

### Words

the, cow, performs, a, very, nice, looping

### Constituents

- "The cow" = NP (noun-phrase)
- "Very nice" = AdjP (head is Adj)

### Constituents nesting in constituents: hierarchy

looping = NP ()
performs a very nice looping = VP (verb phrase)
performs = tv (trans... verb)
a very nice looping = NP
a = det (determinant?)
very nice looping = N
very nice = AdjP (adjective phrase)


## Paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations

**Paradigmatic** relations are vertical, the word can be replaced e.g.

- "Susan hits John"
- "Bill hits John"
- "Paul hits John"
- "Bill sees John"
- "Bill hits Susan"
- etc.

Noun can be replaced with pronouns and noun-phrases ("the Cow"), for example:

- "Susan hits the cow"
- "He hits John"

**Syntagmatic** relations are horizontal, words can be ordered in specific ways to form grammatically well-formed sentences. 

## Noun phrase

What are noun phrases?
- Pronouns ("he/she")
- Nouns ("man", "cow")
- Determiner ("the", "a")

**Why are they in the same 'class'? I.e. why are these all noun-phrases?**

They belong to the same paradigm and can be interchanged in a sentence.

## Prepositional phrase

- Noun-phrase may contain a prepositional phrase
- Prepositional phrase contains a noun-phrase

(Potentially infinite)

## Verb phrase

Sentence is about an event with participants. 
And participants have properties.

- Intransitive event, for example "walk" (verb) (requires no compliment)
- Transitive event, "hit" (verb + direct object (NP)) () (requires one compliment)
- Ditransitive "deliver" (verb + indirect object (NP/PP), direct object (NP)) (requires two compiments)
- PP-object "to count (on)" (verb + prep-object (PP))
- Subject predicate "to be" (verb + subject predicate (NP or AdjP))

Subject predicate = naamwoordelijk gezegde

Ditransitive: the indirect object and direct object are siblings, for example:

"He gives me a book"

- "He" = noun phrase
- "gives" = verb
- "me" = direct object
- "a book" = indirect object
  - "a" = determinant
  - "book" = noun

## Phrases

Noun phrase = noun + everything that can be combined with a noun
Adjective phrase = adjective + everything that can be combined with a adjective
Verb phrase = verb + everything that can be combined with a verb
Adverb phrase = adverb + everything that can be combined with a adverb

## This can help

- NP = subject or object or indirect object
- PP = part of NP (sudent *without* VU-net ID), part of indirect object (he passed the ring *to* me), prepositional object (now look *at* the blackboard, adjunct (I saw him *on* the campus)

- The main verb is the head of the sentence
- The main verb gives you the number of arguments (participants)
- Next to the arguments (mandatory) there can also be adjuncts (optional)

## Syntax and ambiguity

### PP-attachment

"I see a man with my eyes."

- Does the man have my eyes?
- Or do I see using my eyes?

### Scope

"Old men and women are annoying."

- Are old women annoying, or all women?

### Argument or adjunt

"I count on my computer."

- Do I count on my computer to work
- Do I perform mathematics on my computer

## From syntax to semantics: semantic roles

- Agent – Hennie jumped on the train (Hennie is an agent i.e. the thing that 'does', is in control, performs action consciously)
- Patient – Hennie fell (No control. Undergoing the action. Still Hennie is the subject)
- Theme – Hennie slept (Involved, but not as patient or agent. Not 'doing' or 'undergoing' sleep. Theme implies being involved)
- Instrument – He opened the door *with the key* ()
- Source/Path/Goal – He walked from A through B to Z ()
- Recipient – *He* received flowers from me (Receiving has a recipient)
- Benificiary – He gave flowers to *me* (Giving has a benificiary, a giver) 

### Semantics and syntax

The father hit his son with a hammer > The son was hit (by his father) with a hammer

Rephrasing the sentence doesn't change the semantic roles of the words and phrases. It does, however, change the syntax tree.

### Organization of information in language

There is a door, a key. The door is closed but will be open in the near future. I am the cause, a key is involved.

Choose your tools:
- A verb
- syntactic functions to be divided over the participants
- Semantic roles to be divided over the participants

Solutions: 

- "I open the door with a key"
- "The door is opened"
- "The key was used to open the door"
