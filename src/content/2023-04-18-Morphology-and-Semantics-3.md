Construction grammar as opposed to generative grammar.

In generative grammar, linguistic modalities are split up into components.

Innate universal grammar refers to the idea that humans are born with an innate knowledge of the basic grammatical structures of language, which allows them to learn and use language more easily. This theory was proposed by Noam Chomsky, who argued that there must be some kind of innate language faculty in the human brain that enables us to acquire language so quickly and effortlessly.

Generative grammar, on the other hand, is a particular framework for describing the grammatical structures of language. According to generative grammar, a sentence is not just a sequence of words, but is generated by a set of rules that define the structure of the language. These rules can be used to generate an infinite number of sentences, which is why the theory is called "generative."

Chomsky's theory of innate universal grammar is closely related to generative grammar, since he argued that the innate language faculty in the brain is what allows us to generate and understand grammatical sentences. Chomsky proposed that the human brain is pre-wired with a set of rules or principles that underlie all human languages, and that these rules are responsible for our ability to generate and understand grammatically correct sentences.

## Innate universal grammar

- Innate: humans are born with it
- Universal: it is the underlying 

## Generative grammar

In generative grammar, there are autonomous components for linguistic modalities. The components are split into levels and modules. The components are interlinked through linking rules. There is a lexicon that functions across all components.

### Problem with idiom

- Sometimes meanings are hard to predict, e.g. 'pull a fast one'
- Figurative meaning, e.g. lend a hand

Generative grammar is compositional. For example in syntax, a noun and a determiner forms a noun phrase. A noun phrase and a verb phrase form a sentence. 

Semantics and syntax of idioms can't be predicted just by words and grammar.

There are different types of idioms:

- Encoding idioms
- Decoding idioms

Formal idioms can be seen as 'constructions'. There are regularities and irregularities. 

Some idioms are:
- Fixed: 'It takes one to know one'
- More or less fixed: 'To pull someone's leg'
- Open slots: 'The X the Y' (e.g. the more the better)
- Collocations: 'heavy rain', 'strong wind', 'dense fog'
- Selection restrictions: 'blonde hair', 'blonde dog', 'blonde beer'. (But e.g. not 'blonde bee' even though they may be the same color)
- Pragmatic formula: 'have a nice day'
- Compositional: 'My name is Kris'

Top is completely fixed, bottom is completely open.

Exercise: identify compositional and non-compositional 

### Question Croft and Cruse

Identify sentences

## Cognitive / construction grammar

[Wikipedia â€” cognitive grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_grammar)

## Linguistic war

There's been an ongoing mutual ignorance between generative and cognitive linguistics.

## Cognitive linguistics 

Language exists for humans to express and communicate meaning. How is meaning encoded in language?

## Frequency of idioms

Idiomatic language is used more frequently than purely compositional language. This also applies to irregular verb conjugations and irregular noun plurals. In fact, the reason irregularities come to exist is because a phrase is used frequently, and changes in its use. 

## Saeed chapter 2: Reference and denotation

Words point to things in the world:
- Noun point to entities
- Adjectives point to properties
- Verbs point to actions, events and states

Grammatical words tie the content words together to form sentences. Some grammatical words, for example articles determine the truth value of a sentence. The sentence 'a cow is sick' may have a different truth value from 'the cow is sick'.

Sentences express statements, and have truth values. 

### Variable reference

Some words have a variable referent. Some don't. For example:
- Hennie van der Vliet has a fixed referent
- The linguistics professor has a variable meaning, and depends on the context. 'She' is another example of a variable referent.

### Meta-language

A dictionary entry 'throw', can have attributes such as 'transitive' or 'intrasitive'
