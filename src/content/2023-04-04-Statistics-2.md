## Today

- Relationship between theory and measurement
- Introduction to estimation: point and interval estimates
- Descriptive statistics

All material in chapters 1,2,3 

## Research question and goal

## Notation

- Greek characters are used for population parameters
- Latin characters are used for sample parameters

## 95% Confidence interval

95% has to do with the procedure we use to calculate the interval. The procedure gives the right answer 95% of the time (whatever that means).

The point estimate + positive and negative margin of error (MoE) is the 95% confidence interval.

- The spread in the sample influences the MoE.

## Plausibility of candidate values

Inferential statistics:
- Point estimate = sample mean
- Interval estimate = 

Both say something about the population

## Descriptive statistics

When mean and median are close, the distribution of scores is quite symmetrical.

When the SD is higher, the mean is less representative of the typical value.

IQR = 75th percentile - 25th percentile

## Jamovi troubleshooting

If something doesn't work. Make sure a variable has the correct variable type (i.e. ordinal, ratio, nominal etc.)
