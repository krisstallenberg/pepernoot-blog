## On dictionaries

Dictionary gives the lexemes. Generally, dictionaries provide entries for all non-productive derivations. In practice, many frequently-used productive derivations are included. 

What are inclusion criteria for words in dictionaries?
- Usage frequency (based on corpora)
- Consistency (complete sets)
- Non-productive derivations

## Morphological rules

Derivations can be viewed as
- A process: a set of rules
- The result of a process: a listed complex words lexicon

Two forms:

1. Concatenative
   - 2 ordered morphemes
   - Affixation + compounding
2. Non-concatenative
   - Bit more problematic (the general rule doesn't apply) and less frequent
   - e.g. base modification

### Morpheme-based model

- Like syntactic rules
- Restrictions (you don't want to include rules that allow for word-forms that don't exist)
- Morphology is the study of the combination of morphemes to yield words
- Based on morphology as a process

Lexical entries are roots and affixes, to build derivations, inflections, and compounds. 

The morphological rules are inherently part of the morphemes. The lexicon is relatively small. 

Problem: in Armenian, 'armik' means army and 'armiq' means armies. This is a base modification. Solution: zero affix.

### Word-based model

- Words are central (roots, stems, compounds and some other complex words)
- System external explanation
- Less emphasis on restrictions
- Morphology is the study of systematic covariation in the form and meaning of words
- Deals better with Non-concatenative morphology
- Based on morphology as a result

Lexical entries for all word-forms, including inflections such as noun plurals.

On top, there are word-schemas, which can include generalizations, such as [/Xz\] = 'the plural of X'.

Word schema's have a formalism: multi-line square brackets.
Word schema's express generalizations and contain:
- Pronounciation
- Syntactic properties
- Meaning
- Variables (the variable distinguishes a word schema from a lexical entry)

Word schemas aren't restrictuve. They include overgeneralizations because their variables are only restricted by type.

In 'illusive' (N) and 'illusive' (A), morpheme-based models don't have rules to 

#### Linguistic competence versus performance

- **Competence**: the system of unconscious knowledge that one knows when they know a language.
- **Performance**: the actual use of language in concrete situations. 

Truckdriver is not in a dictionary. It is therefore not 'competent'. However, if you use it, it will be understood, meaning it is 'performant'.

> Regarding the example given, the fact that "Truckdriver" is not in a dictionary does not necessarily mean that it is not part of one's linguistic competence. Competence includes the ability to generate and understand novel constructions and words based on the rules of the language. So, if someone has the knowledge of the morphological rules of English, they can combine "truck" and "driver" to form "truckdriver" and understand its meaning, even if it is not listed in a dictionary. However, if "truckdriver" is not a commonly used term, then it may not be part of most speakers' linguistic performance, and its use may sound odd or be misunderstood.

## Recall and precision

If you describe a pattern, like "I want a rule to identify all things that are 'dog'". You create a rule to predict whether X is or isn't a dog.

The rule will lead you to select:

- True positives
- False positives
- True negatives
- False negatives

Recall: How many of the relevant items are selected, (true positives/)
Precision: how many of the selected items are relevant. (true positives/)

It's easy to maximime:
- Recall: Rule includes everything. False negatives are included, but all positives are included!
- Precision: Rule is extremely narrow. No mistakes is perfect precision.
