## a. Evaluation

### Author

The article is written by Ben Zimmer, an American linguist, lexicographer, and language commentator with a BA in linguistics.  

### Purpose

The article is labeled as an opinion piece. It is published in the New York Times, a newspaper. Therefore, I assume the purpose of the article is to both inform and entertain. 

A news article, I would hope, is written to inform the reader. Although one could argue that newspapers commodify news into entertainment, which can in turn be monetized using adtech. 

However, this article is an opinion piece, which means that the author shares their opinion, most likely to entertain the reader, and perhaps to evoke thoughts or questions.

### Objectivity

The author provides many citations. The text does not contain many emotion-rousing words. And the author does not seem to have an affiliation to an institution that may cause a bias.

### Accuracy

None of the citations that the author provides have identifiable sources. I have been able to verify some of the quotes by Noam Chomsky, by locating the original interview. I assume, as this is a newspaper article, that it has been reviewed. However, the editor is not listed on the page. I have not found any spelling errors. 

### Reliability and credibility

Generally, the New York Times is a respectable news outlet. I would expect their articles to be of high quality and accuracy. Furthermore, the author is an academic in the field of linguistics, which is the topic of this article. Therefore, I assume he has approached the writing with academic rigor, and sufficient background knowledge.

### Other

The page is served securely and unaltered from a domain owned by the New York Times over the HTTPS protocol. 

The article is written in 2011. It is on computational linguistics, a rapidly changing field of research and practice. The content of the article may therefore be slightly outdated. 

## b. Classification

Specialist writing

## c. Purpose

This article can be used as a starting point for research. To find inspiration for a scientific hypothesis, or to gather opinions on the matter.

## a. Evaluation

### Author

At the time of writing, Ji Young Kim was an assistant professor and the Bradley University. She had majored in Public Relations. 

Jinhyon Hammick was an associate professor at the University of Florida with a PhD in advertising.

The paper is on corporate communication on Twitter, a field that both authors have academic interest and expertise in.

### Purpose

The page is a research article, published in a scientific journal, Prism Journal. Therefore, the article likely has a scholarly audience and a purpose to inform and explain.

### Objectivity

The article is written in a factual manner, fitting for a research paper. Both writers are affiliated to educational institutions, therefore I don't think the topic Twitter is of personal (economic) interest to them.

The writing style is academic and the tone is neutral, free of strong emotions. 

### Accuracy

All references are listed (in APA-style notation) in the article. The sources of information are therefore all traceable and verifiable.

I have not found any spelling errors.

### Reliability and credibility

Prism journal is an open access peer-reviewed public relations and communication research journal. The editorial board consists of an international group of scholar, mostly based in New Zealand, the United States and Australia.

I had not previously heard of the journal. However, that doesn't say much as the field of research is new to me altogether. 

### Other

The page is served securely and unaltered from a domain owned by the Prism Journal over the HTTPS protocol. 

## b. Classification

Academic writing

## c. Purpose

This source is a research article and can be used in many forms. For example, to base an article on its discussion paragraph or to aggregate in a systematic review or meta-analysis.

## a. Evaluation

### Author

Monica A. Rankin is a Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Dallas. She teaches a US history class.

The page is about her teaching. 

### Purpose

The article is written as a public statement about a video chronicling a class that the author taught. The purpose is to provide contextual information relevant to the video. The audience are people that have seen the video. It is not written in an academic manner.

### Objectivity

The topic of the page is subjective, as the author writes about her own experiences of teaching a class. Also, she reflects on her own undertakings. Therefore, the page can be seen as the author's opinions on a didactic method employed in her teachings.

### Accuracy

The author provides only one direct source, which is the video her writing is about. Other links she includes aren't sources (or at least not marked as such), but rather complimentary reading on similar topics. 

### Reliability and credibility

The author reflects on her experiences with using Twitter in the classroom, as a teacher. I don't think she has an interest in framing her experiences in any certain way.

### Other

Judging by the author and her class' lacking familiarity with Twitter, I assume the writing is quite outdated. Also, many of the links provided for further reading are broken. 

## b. Classification

Non-academic, specialist writing

## c. Purpose

Given the outdated nature of the writing and the rise of teaching technology (as alternatives to using Twitter in the classroom) in the past years, the writing isn't useful as a resource on teaching tools. It can be used as a source on how Twitter was used. 

# 4. `http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cha10influence.pdf`

## a. Evaluation

### Author

All authors are of the paper are named and affiliated to academic research institutes. At least two of them are professors.

### Purpose

The page published is a research article. It is published by the Stanford Network Analysis Project. Therefore, the purpose is likely to inform and share research findings.

### Objectivity

The research is performed by researchers associated to multiple institutions. Therefore, it is harder to identify a single source of interest. Therefore, one could argue that the heterogeneous background of the researchers indicates less bias.

The language of the article is neutral and scientific.

### Accuracy

All sources are listed and uniformly formatted in the references section of the article. Furthermore, the article is reviewed by the editorial crew of the Stanford Network Analysis Project. 

### Reliability and credibility

The Stanford University is a renowned academic institution. Since the Snap project is funded and therefore governed by the Stanford University, it's publishing have a higher credibility.

### Other

## b. Classification

Academic writing

## c. Purpose

The article can be used to deepen technical understanding of the graph relationships between tweets and Twitter users. The article uses network analysis tools to answer questions about *what* measures affect Twitter users' influence. 

# 5. `http://arno.uva.nl/document/645604`

## a. Evaluation

### Author

Alice Brunelli was a master's student at the time of writing (2017). Her master's programme was 'Communication Science' and the article's topic is conversation polarisation on social media. This matches her area of expertise. Albeit a relatively undeveloped expertise, in comparison to professional researchers or PhDs.

### Purpose

The author wrote the article as a Master's thesis. One could argue that the purpose therefore is to write a solid research article to demonstrate her scientific and/or academic skills.

The audience of the article is scholarly and a certain degree of prior knowledge is likely expected.

### Objectivity

The article is written with an academic and neutral tone of voice. The topic of the article is the relative polarization of the platforms Facebook and Twitter. Since the student appears to have affiliation to neither company, she comes across as unbiased. 

The page is published on the arno subdomain of the UvA website. UvA is an academic institution and the arno subdomain hosts a range of academic publications.

### Accuracy

The author has listed all references in standardized formatting. The article has been supervised by Mw. Prof. dr. Guda van Noort, a professor in Persuasive Communication at the University of Amsterdam.

### Reliability and credibility

The information on the site is hosted by the University of Amsterdam, which is a renowned academic research institution. 

### Other

## b. Classification

Academic, specialist writing

## c. Purpose

The research article can be used as a start for further research. Or as a means to learn more about the topic. Since the paper is 5 years old and the field of social media research is rapidly changing, it can also be used as a baseline for comparison, if the methodology can be reproduced over time.

# 6. `http://www.pearanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf`

## a. Evaluation

### Author

The writer of the article is not listed on the page. However, the publishing firm, Pearanalytics, is. 

Pearanalytics is a digital marketing agency that provides services geared towards online strategy, search, web and automation. 

### Purpose

The intended audience are most likely commercial prospects and/or existing clients of the firm. Judging by the writing style, the intended audience is not academic or technical.

The objective of the writing is likely to (up)sell a service.

### Objectivity

The information is presented as factual. The article discussed research performed by Pearanalytics, however, the methodology is not clearly described. Therefore, it is hard to verify the validity of the study design, let alone the findings. 

The article cites a 15-year old alongside a supposed 'Internet marketing expert', neither with accompanying credentials. These citations are used to validate the research's findings.

### Accuracy

No sources are provided for the research performed. The method, authors and sources are unknown to the reader of the article. 

It is unclear whether the information in the article has been reviewed.

The article contains punctuation errors and poor phrasings. Overall the writing style can't be classified as professional.

### Reliability and credibility

Readers might believe the information from the website because the authoring firm is a provider of technological services and therefore specializes in the subject. However, the purpose seems to be lead-generation, rather than genuine research. 

### Other

The page is served over HTTP and is therefore not secure. 

## b. Classification

Specialist writing (albeit commercial specialists)

## c. Purpose

Personally, I would not use this article as a source.
