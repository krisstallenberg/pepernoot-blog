## Course overview

h.d.vander.vliet@vu.nl

### Course material

3 books:
- Morphology
- Semantics
- Construction grammar

### Lectures

- Tuesdays are interactive: discuss reading material + lecture
- Thursdays are _really_ interactive: assignment

### Grade

- 50% is based on the assignments.
- 50% is based on the exam. 

## Morphology (part 1)

Words consist of morphemes. There are two kinds:
- Free morphemes: can exist independently.
- Bound morphemes can't exist independently.

the 'h' in 'hear' is not a morpheme, because it can't be systemically applied with the same function.

### What is a word

Are freeze, froze and frozen the same word?

They're all word-forms of the same lexeme.

A lexical unit is a unit of form and meaning. 'School' for example, can mean a building and an institution. Both combinations of form and meaning are distinct lexical units.

Lexemes with similar meanings, such as 'read', 'readable', and 'reader' form _word families_ of _lexeme families_.

The set of word-forms for a lexeme is called a _paradigm_. 

#### Inflection and derivation

- Inflection is a word and it's word forms. Change in tense, number, case. Change in word-form, same lexeme.
  - Easier to predict
- Derivation is making a new word based on other words. Change in lexeme, same word family.
  - Harder to predict

#### Root, stem and base

Root: the smallest unit with lexical meaning. Free morphemes are roots.
Stem: word-form that is ready for usage in a sentence. This may include morphology (often times it's the root + optional derivational affixes)

Every root is a stem. Not every stem is a root.

Derivation always precedes inflection.

### [Allomorphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allomorph)

Some morphemes have different pronounciations based on their context. For example
- In 'stops', the final 's' is voiceless.
- In 'heals', the final 's' is voiced (due to assimilation).

### Compounding

Combining stems to form new words.

Agglutination is an aspect of syntheticism.

## Token vs type

Tokens are occurences of types. Every occurence of a type is called a token.

Tokens can be different inflections of the same type. For example [be, is, was] are all tokens of the type 'to be'.

Types are lemmas of:
- Noun: the single form.
- Verb: the infinitive form.

## Morphological research

### Elegant description

A morphological rule must be simple. For example, to form the plural of a noun, append '-s' (given exceptions, such as 'sheep').

### Coginitively realistic

A morphological rule must be something you can work with. The rule must be cognitively plausible. 

Hennie says that human language processing is more likely to rely on pattern-matching rather than rule-application.

It seems that the criterion of elegancy therefore contradicts the criterion of coginitive realism.

### System-external 

If a language has only two words for colors, they are black and white. 

If a language has morphological plural forms for nouns at all, it will have plurals for nouns denoting people. 

These are examples of rules that are external to language, but rather based on how we perceive the world. 

### Restrictive architecture

A general grammatical theory for describing all lanuages.

For example: if fronting is possible, it is possible with syntax, not with morphology.

## Orientations in linguistics

Functionalist:
  - Looking for system-external explanations
  - For example John L...

Generative:
  - Universal Grammar
  - Chomsky

[Cognitivist]():
  - More or less a reaction on generative linguistics
  - See language as a product of cognition
  - For example, head has many meaning but they share a common set of ideas [top, master, beginning]

[Structuralist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_linguistics):
  - Language as a system in itself
  - Corpus-based
  - Statistical
