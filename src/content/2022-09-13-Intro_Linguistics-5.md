# Morphology

**Form:**
- Phonetics
- Phonology
- Morphology
- Lexicon
- Syntax

**Meaning:**
- Semantics

**Use:**
- Pragmatics

- Phonetics studies phones (sounds)
- Phonology studies phonemes (sounds with meaningful difference)
- Morphology studies morpheme (underlying unit of language in the brain)

## Morphemes

**Morpheme:** The smallest unit of language that has meaning.

'Stops': 
- 'Stop' has meaning
- '-s' has meaning (third-person conjugation)

Words consist of morphemes.

For example, the word 'drivers' consists of 3 morphemes:
1. 'driv' – from the verb 'to drive'
2. 'er' – the agent performing the verb. 
3. 's' – plural tense

## Types of morphemes

1. Free morphemes: has lexical meaning. Means something on its own.
2. Bound morphemes: only has meaning when attached to free morpheme.  
   i. Derivation  
   ii. Inflection

|                      | Derivation | Inflection |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| Change in word class | +          |- |
| Expands vocab        | +          | -|
| Closest to stem      | +          | -          |
|Predictable/productive |-| +|

#### Derivation

Used to add new words to the vocabulary (walk > walk + er). '-er' is a derivational affix.

Changing a word. For example, change a verb to a noun.

Harder to predict. 


##### Examples

`guitar > guitarists`

Why?
- Word type hasn't changed (this is reason against)
- Meaning has changed. 'Guitar' is an instrument, 'guitarist' plays the instrument.

#### Inflection

Used to combine words in utterances. I walk, he/she 'walks'. '-s' is an inflectional affix.

Adding an affix for grammatical purposes is inflection. 

- Never a change in word class.
- No new word added to vocabulary
  - Inflections do not need to be learned separately. For example, you don't learn the conjugation of words.

##### Examples

`Great > greater > greatest`

Why?
- Meaning doesn't change
- Word is still an adjective (hasn't changed in word type)

**Unless**, 'greatest' is used as a noun, as in "The greatest", then it's derivation.

`guitar > guitars`

Why?
- Meaning doesn't change
- Word is still an adjective (hasn't changed in word type)

## Root, stem, affix

Root is like a free morpheme. Smallest unit with lexical meaning. Undivisable.

Stem: word form that is ready for usage in sentences.

Stem = root plus (optional) derivational affix.

- Violinist = violin (root) + 'ist' (derivational affix)
- Stem = violinist (violinist is a word in a dictionary)
- But also: Stem = violin

> 'Violin' can be a stem and a root, but 'violinist' is not a root!

- Bound morpheme is no stem and no root.
- Free morpheme is 

Graph (mermaid)
- Morpheme --> Free or Bound
- Free --> Stem or Root
- Bound --> Prefix, infix, suffix


### Abstract root

Roots are often stems. However, not all roots are stems. 

For example, 'liber' (from Latin) in 'liberty' and 'liberal' is an abstract root. It can't be used as such.

## From root to stem to word

Root + derivative = stem > stem + inflection = 'word'

Driv + er = driver > driver + s = 'drivers'

Derivation happens *first*, inflection happens *second*.

## Internal structure of words

A morpheme with more than one morph: 'allomorphs'.

[-s] and [-z] are allomorphs: two realizations of the same morpheme in two different phonetic environments.

## Root, stem, affix

- Drive = root
- Drive = stem
- Driver = stem (derivation + '-er')
- Drivers = word (stem + inflection)

## Affixis

There are three types of affixes:
1. Prefix: before the stem ('un-believable', 'un-impressed')
2. Suffix: after the stem ('bear-able', 'believ-able')
3. Infix: in the stem ('cup-s-ful' 'passer-s-by')

## Compounding

Two or more stems form a new word:

- Smalltalk (small + talk)
- Doorstep (door + step)
- Whiteboard (white + board)

Compounding is *productive*: 

N + N = railroad
A + N = blackboard
V + N = playback, turnstile

## Derivation: tree structure

Forgetfulness (N) --> forgetful (A) , ness (affix)
forgetful --> forget (V) , ful (affix)

## Other morphological processes

- Reduplication: Indonesian plural for Rumah 'house' is Rumah-rumah 'houses'.
- Alternation (morpheme-internal modification): drinken-drenken, liggen-leggen (lie-lay), zitten-zetten. 
- Suppletion: irregular stems of e.g. verbs are: am, is, be, was

## Lexicon: content words and function words

In the lexicon are two words:
1. Content words: have meaning. Refer to something.
    - Open classes (noun, verb, adjective, adverb)
    - Lexical content
    - Not very frequent
    - Stress
2. Function words: 
    - Closed classes (article, preposition, conjunction)
    - Functional (act like 'glue' in sentences)
    - Frequent
    - No stress


Languages have ~ 250-300 function words

### Zipf's law

The distribution of content and function words in natural language 

Word frequencies are 1 / rank (in frequency)

For example, the 3th most used word in a corpus/language is used 1/3 times as much as the most-used word.
The 500th most used word in a corpus is used 1/500 times as much as the most-used word.

## Morphological language types

- Analytical languages: little or no bound morphemes in words, mostly words consisting of a free morpheme (a root).

- Synthetic languages: many bound morphemes. 
  - Many bound morphemes. 
  - E.g.

### Types of synthetic languages

#### Agglutinating

- SchuSwaffengebrauch: "shoot weapon use"
- Michoacan (Aztec/Mexican): 
  - kali "house"
  - mokali "your house"
  - nokali "my house"
  - mokalimes "your houses"

#### Fusional
- Like agglutinating languages, but
  - Forms are less clear: affixes fused with an abstract root
- For example, Spanish:
  - ablo "I am speaking"
  - abla "(s)he is speaking"
  - able "I spoke"
  - But no morpheme 'abl'

#### Polysynthetic
- Combining stems and affixes within a word
- Often: incorporating nouns in verbs
- For example 'fishcatching' in Sora cx(4.3.6 in Book)

### Exercises with synthetic languages: agglutinating languages

Dutch: diminitive --> allomorphs of the same morpheme 'je' in different phonetical environments

- Bal-letje 
- Vis-je ()
- Koning-kje (Assimilation)
- Bakker-tje ()
- Boom-pje (Assimilation)
