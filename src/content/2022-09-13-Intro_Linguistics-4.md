# Phonology

The sound *patterns* of a language as stored in the brain. These are language-specific patterns. 

**Phoneme**: a distinctive sound that distinguishes meaning in a specific language.

Example: English has the phonemes /p/ and /b/ because they distinguish the meanings of words, e.g. 'bear' versus 'pear'.

## Phonemes and allophones

Phoneme: mental representation of a speech sound in the brain of users of a specific language.

Different *environments* (sounds surrounding a speech sound) in which phonemes are realized create different [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone) of the same phoneme.

- One phoneme may have multiple allophones/realizations

What sound precedes a phoneme? What sound follows a phoneme? Is the phoneme in the beginning or end of the word?

## Three main types of relationships between sounds

### 1. Contrastive sounds: minimal pairs

When two sounds create a difference in meaning of words, they are called **contrastive**.

**Minimal pair:** Two words that differ in only **one** phoneme. Examples:

- She's – cheese
- him – gym
- there – dare – hair

> Are sounds x and y contrastive?
> 
> Find a minimal pair. 

### 2. Complimentary distribution

Two or more allophones of one phoneme may only occur in mutually excluding, different environments.

### 3. Free variation

Dutch *rood* 'red' [rot] [Rot], the two allophones [r] and [R] of the phoneme /r/ may both be used in the same phonetic environments. And they do not cause a change in meaning.

These variations are often geographically and/or socially distributed. 

> Are accents free variations?

## Typology of phoneme systems

Average number of consonants: 19-25, and average number of vowels: 5.
Smallest: 11/5
Largest: 120 (Khoisan)

## Phonotaxis: sound rules

- Sound patterns in syllables and words
- What is allowed in a language and what is not
  - consonant-vowel patterns unique for each language/
- All languages have CVCV patterns. This is the only universal phonotaxical pattern.

Irarowataro (language of Papua New Guinea) CV pattern:
  - has only CV combinations, for example:
    - CV
    - CVCV
    - VCVCV

Loanwords often change slightly in their pronunciation based on the phonotaxis of the adapting language.

# Phonological processes

- [Assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)): onweer --> omwer
- [Dissimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissimilation): epta --> efta
- [Insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis): adding a sound
- [Deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision): leaving a sound out
- [Metathesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metathesis_(linguistics)): psychologie --> spychology

In the book, there are many more (!), for example:

- Aspiration
- Substitution
- Gliding

Strengthening: [t] --> [th]
Weakening: pronouncing 'water' with flap /t/

## Phonetics vs phonology

- Phonetics is study of sounds, based on three phonetic characteristics.
- Phonology is study of sound system. Language-specific.

## General phonotactical rules

- Most languages prefer CVCV combinations.
- Most languages prefer voiced-voiceless combinations.
