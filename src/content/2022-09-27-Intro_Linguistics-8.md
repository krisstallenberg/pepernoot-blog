# Pragmatics

Language usage. 

## Principles of communication

Leitmotiv:

> Formulating and interpreting meaning for specific purposes in real-life situtations (communication) is a form of taking action
> 
> Meaning is not encapsulated in an utterance. Meaning emerges from an utterance in a context, situation, intonation, gesture etc.

- A sentence is a statement about reality
- A sentence has a truth value

## Language use

Communicative meaning of language is more than literal sentence meaning. The 'more' is called 'conversational implicature', for example:

- **Sentence:** "It is cold here."
- **Conversational implicature:** "Turn up the heating."
- **Meaning:** "It is cold here. Turn up the heating."

### Cooperation Principle

Paul Grive: cooperation principle (CP)
- People want communication to be effective
- CP consists of four maximes for rational, effective communication:
  - Quality: try to make a contribution that is true
  - Quanitity: do not say more or less than required
  - Manner: be brief, clear, unambiguous
  - Relevance: say what is appropriate in the context
- Explain the link between sentence meaning and what is understood from them

People don't actually follow there maxims (descriptive linguistics), this is called flouting. Flouting (not adhering to) the maxims *does* result in meaningful utterances.

## Language in context

Context changes referent. 

## Speech act theory

by John Searle

Using language is performing acts.

Every sentence is an act. Act types include:

### Direct speech acts

- Statement, for example: "I like to drink coffee."
- Question, for example: "How many cups of coffee do you drink during the day?"
- Request, for example: "Pass me the sugar, please."
- Promise, for example: "I promise to buy you coffee next time."
- Threat, for example: "If you don't buy me coffee, I'll kill you."
- Order, for example: "I order you to take that back."
- etc.

Act types have felicity conditions. For example, the felicity conditions for a request are:
- Speaker thinks the action is not yet done
- Speakers wants the act to be done
- Speaker thinks the hearer is able to perform the act
- Speaker things the hearer is willing to perform the act

### Performative speech acts 

These are a special kind of [direct speech act](#direct-speech-acts).

Some performative speech acts require a very specific context, for example:
- "I sentence you to 200 hours of community service"
- "I declare you husband and wife"

### Indirect speech acts

For respectful communication. 

Requests:
- Can you give me the sugar, please?
  - condition: hearer is able to perform the act
