The relationship between form and meaning:

- Thematic roles
- Semantic roles

## Events

Events have participants. 

## Form and meaning

Form and meaning are connected through syntactic roles. 

There are:

- PoS
- Phrases
- Syntactic functions
- Semantic roles

Keep them separate.

## Thematic roles

Theta grid of the verb _to break_:

- break(agent, patient, instrument) e.g.: I (agent) break the vase (patient) with my hands (instrument)

Thematic roles differ between theories. In Saeed, we distinguish:

- Agent
- Experiencer
- Patient
- Theme
- Instrument
- Location
- etc.

### Two thematic roles

"John hits the ball" can be viewed as:

- Agent hits Patient (Action tier: doing-this-to-that)
- Theme hits Goal (Thematic tier: from-here-to-there)

Basically, these are two ways of deriving meaning from the sentence. In the first view, there's an agent who _does_ something. In the second view, there's a theme moving towards a goal. The agency of John isn't emphasizes in the second reading/view of the sentence.

Action tier roles: Agent, Patient, Experiencer, Benegiciary, Instrument.
Thematic tier roles: Theme, Source, Goal, Location.

## Syntactical functions and semantic roles

1. If a sentence contains an agent, then the agent is the subject.
2. Else, if a sentence contains a recipient, then the recipient is the subject.
3. Theme/patient
4. Instrument
5. Location

## FrameNet

The sentences:

- John buys a car from Susan
- Susan sells a car to John

Refer to the same event. The perspective on the event determines the 'frame'.

The sentences:

- I crawled through the Kalverstraat to Dam Square
- I walked through the Kalverstraat to Dam Square
- I ran through the Kalverstraat to Dam Square

All refer to similar events. Even the verbs all imply agency and locomotion.

### The idea of FrameNet

Think of a _financial transaction_ event in terms of:

- A seller
- A buyer
- Goods
- Currency

You sold me your car for $100.
For $100, I bought a car from you.

Assignment for next week:

- Questions on what is framenet and how it is organized.
- What is the difference between semantic roles in FrameNet and semantic roles as explained in Saeed
  - Why is this the case?
  - How is this motivated?
  - What does this mean for linguistics?

Try to find out how FrameNet works. Read [the book](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/docs/r1.7/book.pdf). Play with the interface.
