### Research question

Is Ebonic a language or is it merely an English dialect?

### Argumentation schema

#### Conclusion

Ebonic should be considered a language. 

#### Arguments

**Format:** [argumentation type][relationship] argument

1. There is no linguistic or geographical reason that Ebonic could not achieve status as a language distinct from English  
   - 1.1 [authority][Supports 1] Linguists agree that the notion of language is largely or entirely social and political, rather than linguistic.
      - 1.1.1 [example][Supports 1.1] There are cases around the world of two mutually unintelligible linguistic varieties belonging to the same language, for example Chinese dialect.  
      - 1.1.2 [example][Supports 1.1] There are cases around the world of mutually intelligible varieties belonging to different languages, for example Dutch, Flemish and Afrikaans.
      - 1.1.3 [example][Supports 1.1] There are cases around the world of linguistically similar varieties within the same country belonging to different languages, for example Nguni languages.

2. Ebonic is not English corrupted by bad grammar and slang
    - 2.1 [authority][Refutes 2] Some say that Ebonic is not a language, but rather English corrupted by bad grammar and slang.  
      - 2.1.1 [authority][Refutes 2.1] Linguists that have studied Ebonic in detail know that it is not very bad English.  
        - 2.1.1.1 [induction][Support 2.1.1] Ebonic is superior to English in one of its subsystems: the verbal tense aspect.  
          - 2.1.1.1.1 [example][Supports 2.1.1.1] Ebonic has resources for making distinctions among kinds and times of actions and states that can hardly be made in English
           
3. Ebonic can be its own language, despite its similarities with English
    - 3.1 [authority][Refutes 3] Some linguists say Ebonic and English are too similar to be different languages.
      - 3.1.1 [analogy][Refutes 3.1] Scots and English are similar yet separate languages.
        - 3.1.1.1 [example][Supports 3.1.1] The author provides an English translation of a Scots textual excerpt with Scots words mostly being close cognates of English words.
        - 3.1.1.2 [analogy][Supports 3.1.1] In spite of Ebonics lack of recognition as a language it's widely used, unlike Scots. 

4. There are advantages of considering Ebonic to be a language
    - 4.1 [causality][Supports 4] If Ebonic is considered a language, it reforms the discourse and makes it easier to address common misconceptions about Ebonic.
      - 4.1.1 [causality][Supports 4.1] When Ebonic is considered an English dialect, it is contrasted with *standard* English. 
      - 4.1.2 [causality][Supports 4.1] Contrasting Ebonic with *standard* English has two downsides.
        - 4.1.2.1 [deduction][Supports 4.1.2] *Standard* (as arbitrary standard) implies that American English is justified to be the standard.
        - 4.1.2.2 [deduction][Supports 4.1.2] *Standard* (as minimal standard) implies that users of a dialect should learn American English instead.
      - 4.1.3 [causality][Supports 4.1] Considering Ebonic to be a *dialect* may cause the general public to see it as a faulty way of speaking English.

## Part B

### Analysis of argumentation

[//]: # (Assess the type and quality of the argumentation that you have described in part A. Use the various evaluation questions in the text 'What is critical reading'?)
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- Why did the writer select that particular topic of enquiry in the first place?  )
[//]: # (- Why did the writer decide to use that particular methodology, choose that specific method, and conduct the work in)
[//]: # (that way?  )
[//]: # (- Why did the writer select that particular process of analysis?)
[//]: # (- How well-developed are the themes or arguments?)
[//]: # (- Did the theoretical perspective used introduce any potential bias?)
[//]: # (- Are you convinced by the interpretations presented?)
[//]: # (- Are the conclusions supported firmly by the preceding argument?)
[//]: # (- How appropriate are the comparisons that are used?)
[//]: # (- Did the response options, or measurement categories or techniques used affect the data that were collected?)
[//]: # (- Have any ethical considerations been adequately addressed?)
[//]: # (- Does the writing assume a causal connection when there may not be one?)
[//]: # (- Are general conclusions drawn based on only a few examples?)
[//]: # (- Are inappropriate comparisons being made?)
[//]: # (- Might there be other explanations apart from the one proposed?)
[//]: # (- Are there any hidden assumptions that need to be questioned?)
[//]: # (- Is enough evidence presented to allow readers to draw their own conclusions?)
[//]: # (- Does the line of reasoning make sense?)
[//]: # (The entire report covers 2 to 3 pages A4 format.)

#### Completeness

In the first paragraph, the author states understanding why Ebonics might be considered a language requires a closer look at what it takes to make a language, as well as what the differences are between language and dialect. 

However, the author only briefly handles this subject, concluding langauges cannot be distinguished based on geographical or linguistic qualities or uniqueness. The author uses this argument to conclude that no reasons can be found for Ebonic not to be a language.

The author doesn't, however, answer the question they intended to answer, namely what it takes to make a language. Perhaps a broader discussion of this subject would have led to a more complete view on the historic categorization of Ebonic as dialect rather than language. 

#### Argument

Argument 1.1 can be considered as an argument based on authority: the author's statement that linguists generally agree on X, is provided as argument for X. Such arguments are hard to prove and the author doesn't explicitly provide a source for the statement. Generally, the author provides only five references, four of which are introductions to Linguistic subjects.

Arguments 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 are examples to prove that neither linguistic nor geographical factors can be pinpointed as sufficient reason for a language variety to be considered a language. However, all three examples *could* be exceptions to a rule that could disprove the authors position. 

To prove argument 2, the author aims to disprove the notion that Ebonic is English influenced by bad grammar and slang. However, the author never actually disproves this. Instead, the author points to a certain linguistic quality to conclude that Ebonic is superior in one of its subsystems and thus not bad English. However, if Ebonic *did* originate from faulty application of English grammar, it could still have certain superior qualities.

Argument 2.1 can be a straw man fallacy as the reader can't know what the linguists opposing the author's view have argued.

Argument 2.1.1 can be considered as an argument based on authority and has no reference to back the claim up.

Argument 3.1.1.1 is not a very compelling argument by example. The linguistic samples that the author provides show both major phonological and lexical differences between the two languages. No such differences have been shown between Ebonic and English.
