## Chapter 7 and 8

Contents:
- Estimating the difference between two means

To learn about the extent of a difference between a control group and an intervention group:
- Collect the data
- Create descriptive statistics
- Take means of extent and control groups
- Substract one from the other to calculate the difference

### Cohen's d

Cohen's d expresses the differences between the means as a number of standard deviations.
- There's an assumption here that the variance between groups is equal.
- Observations from two groups are combined (pooled), and then the SD is taken from all that data.
  - The result is Dpool (it's cohen's d using the pooled data to calculate the SD)
  
Divide the mean difference by cohen's d:
  - 0.20 is a small effect
  - 0.50 is a medium effect
  - 0.80 is a large effects
