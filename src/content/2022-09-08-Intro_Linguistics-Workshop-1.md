> What are open vs closed word classes?


**Why are so many utterances still novel?**  
Some language domains are ever evolving.
Context is novel.

- Grammar learning in children happens mostly 'spontaneously' or naturally, rather than through reinforcement.
  The best thing to do is to provide input.
  This is supported by theories:
  - Social interaction theory: tinker language use to the individual and/or context.
  - Active construction of grammar theory: the individual learns by trial and error. The individual imitates, applies (trial and error) and learns.
