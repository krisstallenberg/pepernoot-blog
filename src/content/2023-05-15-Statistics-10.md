To compare two groups, use a t-test

## Comparing more than two groups

- Contrast and/or comparison
- Planned versus unplanned
  - Planned: max (k-1) comparisons or contrasts (k is the number of groups), no adjustment.
    - Anova > Anova > Post-hoc tests > Check **No correction**.
  - Unplanned: as many pair-wise comparisons as you like, but with adjustment for multiple comparisons.
    - Anova > Anova > Post-hoc tests > Uncheck **No correction**.

### Linear combination

Calculate the sum of weighted means. For every mean, multiply by its weight. A contrast coefficient means that the sum of the weights amounts to 0. 

To get a number you can interpret on the original scale, make sure the asbolute sum of the weights equals 2. This is regardless of the amount of means you compare. 

## ANOVA

Interpretation of the omega-squared value from the ANOVA test (see learning statistics with Jamovi for more details):

- .01 = small
- .06 = medium
- .14 = large

## What analysis to perform

- Only continuous/scale data: correlations
- Only nominal data: proportions
- Nominal variable plus scale variable: mean difference
