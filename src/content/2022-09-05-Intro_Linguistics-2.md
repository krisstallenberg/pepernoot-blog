# Child language acquisition

- Nature/nurture debate
  - *Forbidden experiment:* you can't experimentally exclude a child from nurture/upbringing
    - There have been a few case studies
- Innate/non-innate debate (walking vs playing piano)
  - Does it happen naturally, or does it happen?
  - Or do we need to practice talking? Like playing the piano?

# Language use theories

## Universal Grammar (nativists)
- **Chomsky**: we have an innate universal grammar
  - It's universal, not language-specific (e.g. English or Dutch)
  - There are universal rules
  - The grammar is part of our nature
  - Language Acquisition Device
    - All languages have verbs
    - Specific language determines things like syntax: e.g. Subject-Object-Verb
  - There's a poverty of stimulus: we aren't exposed to all forms of grammar before we can use them
    - There's no perfect input/stimulus
  - Sensitive/critical period for language learning
  - Universal grammar is an abstract/fundamental form of grammar (non-language specific). 

### Critical/sensitive period

- A period in human development which is optimal for tuning the part of the brain best suited to the acquisition of language
- Eric Lenneberg (1967): critical period it's around puberty
- Steven Pinker (1994): sensitive period: up to age of six, is steadily compromised from then.

> Brain changes over time. 

> Video Genie: example of forbidden experiment. Girl who was discovered at age 13. Feral child. Deprived of human interaction for 12 years.

> Used as an argument for critical/sensitive period. Lexicon *can* be learned at later age. Grammar can't be learned at later age.

We have a universal grammar, but there is a sensitive period during which we can learn/apply it.


## Imitation theory (constructivists)

- B.F. Skinner
- Behaviourism/imitation/reinforcement

Children imitate their parents + positive/negative feedback 

Mistakes are the product of creative use, not false imitation.

Negative evidence on grammar is ineffective.

**Counter argument:** children do make mistakes. Not all utterances are strict imitation.

## Active construction of grammar theory (constructivists)

- Children 'crack' the language by trial and error
- Children are creative
- U-shaped behaviour (brought (direct imitation), bringed (incorrect application of grammatical rule), brought (acquired grammar, through *active* usage)) 
  - Imitation > Learning > Acquisition
  - A child imitates a phrase, the child 'plays' with the phrase e.g. applies a grammatical rule, feedback is given, more input + statistical analysis is applied, the rule is learned/acquired.

## Connectionist theory (constructivists)

- Children learn language by creating neural connections in the brain
- By using language these connections get stronger
- Children extract statistical information
- Frequency of input plays a big role

Neural connections strengthen with language input. Probability analysis. Form connection between words.

## Social interaction theory (constructivists)

- Lev Vygotsky
- Language learning is based on biological and social factors alone
- Language goes beyond statistical analysis
- Child directed speech: high-pitch, repetition, basic sentence structure
  - Children prefer this (based on head turning)
    - Easier to follow

# Developmental phases

There's variation. Not all children learn at the same pace. 

However, generally:

- First 6 months of life: infants prefer to listen to child-directed speech
  - Child can discriminate sounds in *all* languages (language-universal)
    - This ability is necessary to learn sounds, which can then be used to learn words (this is evidence for the sensitive/critical period theory)
    - This ability is lost after 6 months
- After 6 months:
  - recognize high frequency information in the signal
  - Identification of sounds, imitation of sounds (playing around w/ bilabial sounds etc.)
  - Growing preference for native language
    - Losing the ability to discriminate sounds in *all* languages

# Developmental phases

1. Pre-lingual (0;0 – 1;0)
  - Social-interaction
  - Speech sounds: babbling
  - Comprehension of words, phrases
    - First, a child understands. Then, a child produced. A child can understand instructions before it can give instructions (or reply in words)
  - Proto-conversation: make-believe conversation. (prefix 'proto' means first)
2. Early lingual (1;0 – 2;6)
  - One word (1;0 – 1;6): building the lexicon
  - Two words (1;6 – 2;6): combinations of 2 words
  - Multi-word: combination of several words

> Language consists of a set of skills/characteristics. It doesn't 'start' with a child's first words.

3. Differentiation 2;6 – 5;0
  - All components
  - Grammar, verbal inflection, word formation, sentence formation, narratives

4. Completion 5;0 – ...
  - Figurative speech (multiple word meaning)
  - [Implicatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicature)
  - Unwritten rules in language use
    - Knowing when to be respectful, depending on the context
