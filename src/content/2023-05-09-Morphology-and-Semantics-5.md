## Classifying events

There's a system for event types: Vendler

There are:
- Actions (e.g. "The sun ripens the pears"): internal change with agent
- Events (e.g. "The pears ripen"): internal change without agent
- States (e.g. "The pears are ripe"): there's no internal change

The agent is the _doer_, who is in control. So 'fishing' is an action, and 'falling' is an event.

All of these have arguments/participants. Hennie says that this model represents how humans think of the world.

### Situation types

- States: no internal structure
  - Some verbs are static (i.e. refer to state), e.g. : be, like
- Dynamic events: internal structure
  - Some verbs are dynamic, e.g.: walk, learn, flap

The difference lies in whether or not there is internal structure, which entails:
- A temporal aspect (there's a start and/or end)
- Change (e.g. 'sitting' is more stative, 'falling' is more dynamic)

#### Vendler system

Vendler made a system of situation types. The system is more complex than just static vs dynamic.

|Situation|Static|Durative|Telic|
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| State   | +    | +      | n.a.|
| Activity| -    | +      | -   |
| Accomplishment
| Semelfactive
| Achievement 

[Telic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telicity?useskin=vector), based on the Greek 'goal' refers to an action having an endpoint. 



### Tense 

- Past
- Present
- Future

Tense is deictic.

Tense can be expressed with:
- Temporal adverbs e.g. yesterday, in a few seconds
- Verb endings e.g. do, did, will do, had been doing



This can be expressed on a timeline (Reichcenbach):
- Speaking time
- Event time
- Reference time

### Aspect

Are a way to organize event types.

Refers to the distribution of time:
- A point in time
- Ongoing/continuous/progressive
- Finished

### Modality

[Modality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality_(linguistics) refers to a statement's relationship to reality, or truth. For example:
- [Modal auxillaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb)
  - Could
  - Should
  - Would
  - Must
- Modal adverbs

A modal auxillary can be used as:
- Epistemic modal: Refers to the state of the world. "You "
- Deontic modal: Refers to an ideal world, or how the world ought to be. Implies ethics. "You should pay for that yourself"

Thursday: Semantic roles. This is important in NLP.
