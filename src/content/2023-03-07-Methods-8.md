## Feedback on assignment 1

- Levels of measurement are not to be confused with measurement characteristics.
- There's a difference between reasons and explanations:
  - A reason is a reason for believing a claim is true. They can be results.
  - An explanation is an answer to a why-question, not neccessarily to support a claim. 

### Levels of measurement

**Levels of measurement**: relationships between the *scores* and the *thing that is being measured*.

|           | Identity  | Magnitude | Equal unit size | Absolute zero | 
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Nominal   | +         | -         | -               | -             |
| Ordinal   | +         | +         | -               | -             |
| Interval  | +         | +         | +               | -             |
| Ratio     | +         | +         | +               | +             |

Absolute zero: a measured value of 0 means the thing measured doesn't exist. 

### Indepedent versus dependent

Independent is cause, dependent is effect.

## Discussion of assignment 2

Face validity: Whether you think 'at the face' the method is a good way of measuring the concept. 

The measurement lets us draw conclusions about the concept we're trying to measure. In other words, the operationalization of a concept has face validity if you think it lets you draw conclusions about the concept.
