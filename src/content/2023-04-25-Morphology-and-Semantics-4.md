## Sense

For more information, read 'big book on concepts'

### Problem with reference

Reference doesn't deal with the human aspect of language. It only explains the relationship between language and the world, but not between language and thoughts. Sense deals with meaning as a mental representation: thought.

### Sense is a concept

A concept or mental representation can be:
- A mental construction
- A description using neccesary and sufficient conditions
- Characteristic properties
- Defaults: for example, most dogs have 4 legs, but some don't

Together, a concept forms set of expectations.

### Operationalizing sense

Sense can be operationalized as:

- Dictionary definition
- Mental image
- Prototype
- Use

#### Sense as a dictionary definition

Problems:
- Circular: definitions require definitions of the words used, all the way down.
- Does language use require encyclopedic knowledge? Can I talk about gold without really knowing what it is?

#### Sense as a mental image

Problems:
- Some abstract words can't be envisioned
- Mental images across people aren't consistent

#### Sense as use

For example:
- Vlees bakken, cake bakken
- Roast meat, bake a cake

In different languages, words have different uses. These uses define what a word means. 

#### Sense as a prototype

When you think of fish, you think of e.g. tuna. The most typical example of a word functions as a prototype.

When you think of a dog, you may think of a labrador.

Problems:
- Like mental images, we may have different prototypes for the same word.

Prototypes can take a visual form, but not neccesarily. For example, a prototype of 'even' as in 'even number', can be '2' (rather than e.g. '234892346').
