# Computational linguistics

Before computational linguistics, linguistics used introspection as a method to test linguistics. This is also called 'armchair linguistics' i.e. sitting in a chair and thinking about theory.

## Corpus linguistics

Bodies of text allow for:
- practical purposes, for example: lexicography
- theoretical purposes: implementing theory

and NLP, for example:
- Text mining
- Chatbots
- Browsers
- Automatic translations
- Sentiment analysis (one of the VU research topics)
- Text-to-speech / speech-to-text
- Natural language interface for computers (Siri-like technology)
- Dialogue management (database, scripts, frames)
- Text generation
- Automatic speech production

## Open source tools

You can use open source tools, for example to:
- Make concordances
- tag parts-of-speech
- Perform syntactic analysis
- Perform semantic analysis

## Scripts and frames

Are used to process language specific to the domain

Frames are object-oriented descriptions of lexicographic entities.

## Communication with computers

Semantics are bound by context. People can't stop to see meaning in symbols. Computers have no 'idea' where to start to see meaning in symbols.

## Automatic translation 

When translating from a relatively little-used language to another relatively little-used language, does a strong intermediate representation in a language like English help improve the accuracy of the translation?

# Variation in framing

by Levi Remijnse

PhD topic can be on:
- How to improve/build software tools
- Theoretical linguistics (use computational methods to answer linguistic research questions)

## Frame semantics

The meaning of a word is understood against the frame that it evokes in our cognition

Frame: cognitive representation of an event that involves participants
