# Phonetics

Described in three main characteristics:

- [Phonetics](#phonetics)
  - [Voicedness](#voicedness)
  - [Manner of articulation](#manner-of-articulation)
  - [Place of articulation](#place-of-articulation)
  - [IPA notes](#ipa-notes)
    - [Spelling vs IPA](#spelling-vs-ipa)

With combinations of these three characteristics, all speech sounds can be uniquely described and identified.

## Voicedness

When vocal cords vibrate, a *voiced* sound is produced.

**Examples:**
- /z/
- /g/
- /d/
- /v/

- Voiced: Close together and vibrating
- Voiceless: Relaxed and more apart

## Manner of articulation

Manner of articulation: degree of blocking the airstream

Vowels: airstream not blocked at all. Air can freely stream out of mouth or nose

Consonants: airstream is either completely blocked, producing plosives:
- e.g. [p,t,k]

Or partially blocked, producing fricatives:
- e.g. [s,f,x]

**Nasal:** [/m/, /n/, /ng/]

**Flaps:** e.g. the 't' in 'water'. Sounds in between a /d/ and /t/

## Place of articulation

Places in the speech organs where the active articulators (e.g. tongue)

Articulation places, ordered from front to back of mouth:
- Bilabial: with two lips (e.g. /b/, /p/, /m/)
- Labiodental: Combination of lips and teeth (e.g. /f/ /v/)
- Interdental: Between the teeth (e.g. )
- Alveolair: Tongue touches the alveolair ridge (e.g. /t/ /l/ /s/ )
- Velar: Produced  (e.g. /k/ /g/)
- Uvular: Not much used in English, but more in Arabic. (e.g. /h/)

Other places of articulation include:
- Nasal

- /s/: Fricative, voiceless, alveolair
- /d/: Fricative, voiced, alveolair
- /ng/: Nasal, voiced, velar

## IPA notes

- When two sounds differ only in their voicedness, the voiceless character is written first.
- IPA consonants chart is what we'll study
- IPA is always wrapped in square brackets

Consonants (pulmonic)

### Spelling vs IPA

Spelling is rule-bound, whereas spoken language, thus IPA, is not. IPA is a scientific notation of a sound system.

> Isn't IPA rule-bound?
