# Week 1: What is linguistics

The scientific study of language. Expressed in similarities and differences.

Define the terminology through which we study languages. Understand the systematicity of languages (grammar).

## Language families

- Stoel (Dutch)
- Chair (English)
- Kursi (Moroccan Arabic)

At word-level, very little similarities

- De stoel is zwart
- The chair is black
- I-kursi o khel

Article – Noun – Verb - ???

At sentence-level, many similarities between Dutch and English, but not Moroccan Arabic.

## Spoken language

When we talk about language, we talk about *spoken* language. Focus of linguistics is on spoken language.

### International phonetic alphabet

Alphabet of sounds. Contains only consonants, no vowels, no 'clicks'. 

- X-axis: *where* the sound is produced 
- Y-axis: *how* the sound is produced

## Prescriptive and descriptive language

- Prescriptive: the rules. how to use language.
- Descriptive: what people actually do. Recording language use. Studying language use.

**Language competence:** the knowledge of language people have in their brains
**Language performance:** the performance of language

## Characteristics of human language

- Mode of communication and interchangeability: people use language to communicate
- Semanticity (meaning)
- Pragmatic function: knowing how to use a language. Understanding implicit language.
- Cultural transmission: learning by interaction 
- Arbitrariness between form and meaning
- Discreteness & productivity (forming endlessly new entities by composing linguistics elements)
- Displacement: language allows us to step outside our current space and time.

To understand these systems, we need to break them down. Study the parts that compose language. Study the interfaces of these parts. 

## Why do we need linguistics

- Science
- Speech therapy
- Language & speech/hearing technology
- Language education
- Daily life of professionals
  - e.g. writers applying linguistic rules in their writing

## Endangered languages

- Some languages are almost extinct
  - Is that problematic?
    - Loss of language may be the effect of colonialism
  - In order to describe languages, we need a universal system and universal terminology

## Forensic linguistics

- Studying language patterns that are idiosyncratic (Una-bomber)
  - Writing style was identified through linguistic analysis
- Are the writers of text A and text B the same person?
- Is writer X lying or telling the truth

## Child language

Record child language production. Describe (universal) developmental phases. 

> Why would we want to do that?

- To identify irregularities, that may be treated

## Speech therapy

The better we understand the problem, the better help we can provide.

## Language technology

- Software:
  - Text-to-speech
  - Speech-to-text
  - Chat bots
  - Translation programs

Providing software with linguistic knowledge.

The information systems need precise information on e.g. pronunciation. These subtleties may not be characteristics that we are aware/conscious of. 

Speech recognition, variation in people's speech. Programs can learn to better recognize voices/accents over time. 

## Hearing technology

Development and fine-tuning of the cochlear implant. 

## Foreign language teaching

- Explaining/predicting transfer errors
- Exercises for diminishing those errors --> language methods

- **Contrastive linguistics:** differences between languages may explain difficulties that new language learners experience.

## Daily life of professionals

- Correct language use
- Knowledge of and open mind to different languages and cultures
- Optimization of texts in advertising, political texts, news
- Understanding how reading between the lines
